# Step 1: Use the official Golang image to build the Go application
FROM golang:1.19-alpine as builder

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /go/src/app

# Copy the Go Modules manifests
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all the dependencies. Dependencies will be cached if the go.mod and go.sum files are not changed
RUN go mod download

# Copy the entire project
COPY . .

# Build the Go app
RUN go build -o main .

# Step 2: Now copy the Go binary from the build image and run it
FROM alpine:latest

WORKDIR /root/

# Install necessary dependencies (e.g., curl, bash)
RUN apk add --no-cache bash

# Copy the Go binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /go/src/app/main .

# Expose the Go app port
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the Go app
CMD ["./main"]
